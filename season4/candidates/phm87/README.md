I'm candidate to be Notary Node during the next season in order to continue to contribute to iguana (stopcoin, pausecoin, few fixes), enhance notary scripts, support/enhance komodo, contribute to AtomicDEX/mm2 (integration into yiimp ongoing, Lightning Network submarine swaps integration) and maybe launch and support other projects (auto-exchange pool, run komodo on ARM hardware, use HSM).

I tested many things on my phm87_SH node during the 2019-2020 season: my notarization performances were sometimes in the top 3 and sometimes very low. Whatever many notary nodes were impressed by these performances, my node was not re-elected.

KMD Team was very kind and created recently a phm87 branch for my contirbutions to Komodo.

During 2019-2020 season, I gave 20% of my KMD mined to Chips and 20% to KMDLabs (so I gave 40% in total). If I am elected, I will give some of my KMD earnings to some projects but less than 40%.

Thank you,


phm87

## Ongoing:
- [Add AtomicDEX support into yiimp](https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp/compare/next...phm87:AtomicDEX): Orderbooks, manual trading, get prices ... The support of AtomicDEX will add all mm2/AtomixDEX coins into the database of each yiimp pool that merges this future PR. ca333 was very kind and he gave me some RICK and MORTY, I'm planning to let anonymous visitors use the yiimp interface to perform RICK/MORTY trades.
