dudezmobi is a primarily a loving husband the extras includeds being a software and network engineer with 
over a decade and a half of experience in business applications both in service and manufacturing sectors.

I meet the technical and hardware requirements for running a notary node. (2 x i7, 1 x 3900x and 
1 x 3970x and would upgrade as necessary)

I have a total capacity of 2500 watts of solar power for 6.5 hours daily, thus lowering
my operational costs tremendously.

I operate a veruscoin staking pool. (1.5 years, 1 year private for 3 members and 
expanded to a public staking pool last July 2019, with a standard support process, 
HW firewall and redundancy).

I wont give nonsense, moonshot promises and expectations but i would ensure to the best of my ability
100% compliance with NN duties and responsibilities, including timely updates as deemed by komodo team as 
well as reach at least 33% or better monthly NN notarization score, also as a risk mitigation
i am capable to separate my physical servers to two operating sites 100 kms from each other.  

Thank you for your support
