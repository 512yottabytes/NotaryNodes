over a decade and a half of experience in business applications and infrastructure both in **service and manufacturing sectors**.
I meet the technical skills and hardware requirements for running a notary node.

I have a total capacity of **2000 watts** of solar power for 6.5 hours daily, thus **lowering
my operational costs** and a **sustainable model** for a support infrastructure.

I operate a **veruscoin** staking pool. (1.5 years, 1 year private for 3 members during which I *established standards 
process* in administering and maintaining the infrastructure and sustainability, and expanded to a public staking 
pool last July 2019 with features such as **HW firewall, server redundancy and a crappy but reliable discord bot)**.

I wont give *nonsense, moonshot promises and expectations* but I would ensure realistic key performance indicators are met. 
To the best of my ability a **100% compliance** with NN duties and responsibilities, including timely updates **<24H** 
as deemed by komodo team as well as reach at **least 35% or better monthly NN notarization score**, as a **risk mitigation** 
i have the capability and resources to separate my physical servers to two operating sites **100 kms from each other**. and lastly i would also be **allocating 15% of earnings to veruscoin**.

Thank you for your support.
