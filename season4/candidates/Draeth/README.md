<br><h3><b>Who I am</b></h3>
I am Draeth, one of the captains of <a href="https://pirate.black">Pirate Chain</a> and Founder of the <a href="https://bpsaa.vision">BPSAA</a>. I am an electrical engineer by trade, working in Solar, Power Distribution, Power Generation, Telecommunications and SCADA industries. I have a passion for tech, and have owned & operated several successful small businesses. I've been in crypto for the past 4.5 years and have been in the komodo ecosystem for the past 2.5 years. I am a highly motivated and passionate indivitual when it comes to tech and managing anything, especially Pirate Chain and the BPSAA. You can check me out in any of the dozen+ interview's i've done.

<h3><b>Why I'm running</b></h3>
I am running for an NA NN operator position to not only help support the KMD ecosystem, but to also utilize the rewards from the Notary Nodes to help fund both Pirate Chain and the BPSAA. I plan on using 40% of the rewards toward both projects (20% each) to put towards marketing and development.
