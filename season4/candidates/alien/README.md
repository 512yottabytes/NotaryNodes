## Who am I?
Blockchain enthusiast, been with the community since BTCD mining days. Komodo lover, long-term hodler and a reliable Notary Node operator for the last 2 seasons and a NN Guru now. I run my nodes with high-end servers and no compromise on that. Also monitor the nodes and network constantly. With experience on Komodo, iguana and Linux systems, along with operating my nodes, I try to help other operators who needs help. I help the Komodo ecosystem by testing new tech and reporting any issues found to make things better.

## Server Spec
```
alien server
```
---
_Currently I am operating one Notary Node in the AR region `alien_AR` and one Notary Node in the EU region `alien_EU`. Both of them are at the top position in their respective region by performance._

#### Thank you very much for voting for me and trusting me with securing the network.
