# My experience

 - Currently I'm a webshop backend developer (mainly in Python)
 - I'm maintaining more than 50 Linux servers (so I have a lot of bash scripts)
 - Previously I worked in automotive and telecommunications sector, so security and stability is a must for me
 - I graduated at Computer Science Engineering
 - I'm lazy as f***, so I write scripts for everything what I need to do twice.
  
 # How am I involved in Komodo?
 To be honest, I'm not involved yet. I'm learning a lot of the cryptocurrencies, checking the current tools and sometimes I fix them, if you check the source codes of the open source tools, I have some pull requests.
 
 # How I work?
 Currently I don't have the needed hardware for Notary Node operation, but if you give me the chance, I promise that the best hardware and software architecture will be made with high-end security.
