# 2020 Komodo Notary Node Elections.  Season 4

## About Me  
For Season 3, I volunteered to be the operator for Voskcoin's Notary Nodes so that I could brush up on my previous Linux experience but more because I wanted to learn about Komodo and interacting with blockchains from the CLI.
I've learned a lot about what it takes to be a reliable Notary Node this past year and would like to put that knowledge to use on my own Node in the North American region.
