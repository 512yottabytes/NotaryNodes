Hi my name is Hastrup. I’ve been part of the komodo community since 2018 and bought my first coins in 2017. I have been following the progress of komodo with great interest and hope to help it flourish in the future.

I have found 3 other people( aagaardnisme, penguin, Obie1) with the same goals for komodo and we have formed a small team behind this NN proposal. The way we would like to use a position as NN operator is giving back 50% to community projects, we would invest in open source software and similar projects to help grow the foundation for decentralize banking and promote privacy tools for people around the world.

We are going to run with a primary and secondary server setup. The server will be based in Denmark, Danmark has one of the worlds most stable electrical infrastructure, with an uptime of 99+%

There will be a discord server where people can suggest different projects and opensource software that should receive a portion of the 50% of coins earned from the NN. The 50% will be divided into 2 chunks. One for Komodo specific projects and one for opensource software. Until we feel like there’s a voting system in place that cannot be manipulated, the team will have final say in who receives coins. As soon as a trusted voting systems is available, we will have a vote every 3 months for the allocation of the coins.

Server spec:

Primary server Xeon Cpu 128Gb RAM 1Tb ssd 300/300 Internet connection

Secondary server Xeon Cpu 64Gb RAM 500Gb ssd 100/100 Internet connection

We are thankful for your consideration and looking forward to hopefully becoming a NN server and supporting the growth of Komodo.
