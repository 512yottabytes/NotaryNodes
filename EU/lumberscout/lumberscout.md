We first learned about Komodo while researching fundraising options for the Lumberscout project (s. whitepaper below). We worked with jl777 and ca833 and others to get the TALLY assetchain up and running. We've also created an ERC20 TLY token that will use Etomic to bridge assetchains.

As an economic operator with "skin in the game", dPoW is not an abstract concept to us. The life or death of our financial eco-system depends on it. If you vote for us, rest assured, we will never compromise your interests, because to do so would be to compromise our own.
