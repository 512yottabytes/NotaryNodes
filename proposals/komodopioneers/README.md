## Komodo Pioneers Organization ​
**Komodo Pioneers will create the most value for Komodo ecosystem.** 

We have a vision and strategy in place to give financial support to anyone wanting to help us spread the word about Komodo and its ecosystem. 

All who share our vision may join us and help us reach our goals. In other words, while we do marketing for Komodo, we will empower the whole community. 

Komodo is offering astonishing technology, and it is time to start to spread the word! 

Help us grow Komodo and empower people around the world. Visit our website for more information.

## Our Campaign Promise 
**We pledge 50 % of our revenue towards activities that support Komodo ecosystem,** such as events, meetups and podcasts. 

KMD price has to stay above 4 USD for the above to be valid. If the price is below the threshold, then special conditions apply. In essence, the pledged percentage is smaller if KMD price is low to ensure sufficient funding to maintain stable notarization service.
