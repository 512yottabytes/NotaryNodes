## Our Campaign Promise 
**We pledge 50 % of our revenue towards activities that support Komodo ecosystem,** such as events, meetups, and podcasts. 

KMD price has to stay above 4 USD for the promise to be valid. If the price is below the threshold, then special conditions apply. In essence, the pledged percentage is smaller if KMD price is lower to ensure sufficient funding to maintain stable notarization services.

An additional goal is to connect businesses with Komodo's ecosystem, either through our team or a third party.
