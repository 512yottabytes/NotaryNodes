## About Me

I am a UNIX systemadministrator and worked as one for almost 20 years till i quit my last job to be able to concentrate entirely on the Komodo project.
My professional carreer was evenly spread across 3 employers, a server hosting/housing company, a company that was doing software and hardware for air traffic control where i managed the servers of the customers (couple of airports
and some national ATC) and the last time i worked for the german state television.
I entered the crypto space as a simple miner and had my first contact with Komodo when it all started with the swap from BTCD. My main interest was BarterDEX,
so i started setting it up, testing and reporting bugs. I integrated most of the coins in BarterDEX and now i run 2 servers providing some liquidity for all the coins.
I also run 6 separate electrum servers on AWS for BarterDEX and integrated some coins in electrumx-code. Part of the funds will be used to upgrade this electrum servers to better hardware.

* My knowledge: UNIX, Networking, Bash/Perl scripting, Monitoring (Nagios), HA
* My role in the Komodo team: running marketmaker nodes, testing/debugging BarterDEX, running electrum-servers
