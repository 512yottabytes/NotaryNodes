## About me ##

I'm a Linux user since 1999 (I should have said "GNU/Linux", sorry RMS!) for my daily pleasure and my personnal work.

I am a proud Free software user.

I discovered the cryptocurrencies world in early 2013 with Bitcoin, then I've been part of the NXT community (not with this nickname), and followed jl777's work till today, from BitcoinDark and Komodo ICO to these Notary Nodes elections :-)

Few months ago, someone* pushed me to apply for being a STAKER Notary Node operator, and I won 1 of the 20 spots available (see https://kmdlabs.com).
It allowed me to learn the basis of how a Notary Node works, so now I can candidate for a KOMODO one.

## Rewards ##

If you vote for me (and if I win!), I will redistribute a 20% reward of my KMD mining gains on a regular basis.
I'll do my best to not disappoint you, and will compete to have the best performance.

I promise to comply with the **minimum** requirements listed here if elected:
- Region: SH (Australia or New Zealand)
- CPU: Xeon or i7 (8 cores)
- RAM: 64 GB
