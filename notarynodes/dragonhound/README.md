### DragonHound 2019 Notary Node Proposal ###

I'm a bloke with a dog, and I've been part of the Komodo Community since early 2018, spending my spare hours learning, building and testing. Most of this work has ben self-directed until recently when I was honored with a place within the team as a dApp dev, support agent and qa tech.

Before joining the community, I spent the last decade working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), automating cartographic production,  running spatial analysis, managing spatial databases, and running ArcGIS/QGIS training courses. Before that I was a nightshift forklift jockey in cold storage.
I've been an afterhours coder since my old man introduced me to PERL as a youngster, and done a variety of "on the side" contracts over the years using a variety of languages. 

More recently, I've spent the last 7 Aussie summers serving as an "intel" officer during fire suppression incidents in Australia, creating fire spread prediction maps and tools like flir2qr, which delivers hot spot maps from aerial imagery onto the smartphones of on ground crews before the observation aircraft lands to refuel.

## Why you running? ##

I want to help build things to create a decentralised future I'd like to live in, and empower like-minded and motivated community members to do the same.
Running a NN is the next step in learning more and being able to do more. 

## What's in it for the community? ##
Collaboration, content and competitions. I have more ideas than time, and know there is talent within the community worth rewarding.
If you have the time and talent to help, I'd like to tip you with tokens so we can build something awesome.

NN income (after server costs) will be split as follows:
- 40% Premium canine food and apparel
- 20% KMD LABS development initiatives
- 20% GPS/IoT development 
- 10% Monthly community competitions
- 5% Translation bounties for support guides and developer documentation.
- 5% Komodo Pioneers initiatives

Voters will also be offered
	- Quarterly transparency and progress reports
	- At-cost pricing for Dragonhound merch, kit and a free 1 year subscription to the tracking service when launched.
