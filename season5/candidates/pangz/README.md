## 📡Why should I be one of the NN operators?
- Will be the first one to establish a **node** in **Japan**🎌 which will certainly help **strengthen** the notarization process in the **Asian Region**.
- **Sufficient qualities** and **skills** to operate and maintain nodes in securing the blockchain networks **24/7**
- **Committed** to the **responsibilities** that goes with the operation to the best of my **knowledge**, **skills** and **experience**.
- Plan to acquire a **solar battery pack** to power the nodes which will be designed to handle 50% of the power consumption in a form of green energy. In theory, that would give me **30%** to **50% daily uptime** during block-out which is although a rare case.

## 🤝How can I help the community?

- Recently I **developed a mobile app** for verus in verifying block signatures which is currently in testing phase but will eventually be released free of charge for the use of the community. Same way, should **KMD** be needing something similar or any app that might benefit the ecosystem and the community as whole, I'd be happy to spend my time building it.
- Would be happy to **impart my skills and experience** to help produce tools and processes to support this community to enable us thrive and move forward.
