## About me
### Who Am I?
I'm a relatively average girl with a passion for freedom of information, privacy, security and decentralisation. 

For work, I'm currently CTO of a company based in Scotland, I’m a software engineer with a wide range of skills and nearly 15 years of experience to go with it. Having worked for several tech firms, on projects such as the BBC Licencing call handling system, videopoker.com, matalancard.com, saga travel, and many more. My bread and butter is in nodejs / react / typescript development, but I also have a wealth of experience with PHP, and dotnetcore. Furthermore, I’m proficient in UNIX based operating systems and DevOps is a basic part of my day-to-day job.


### Some background
I’ve been paying attention to Komodo since mid-2017, I attended the Komodo Team meetup in Wales in 2018 (when some of you might have known me as Elliott)  [DJI Mavic 2 Pro 4K] Komodo Team Meetup 2018 - Wales, UK - YouTube, and I’ve been paying attention since, but not seeing opportunities that I felt I could contribute my time effectively for.

The idea of running a Notary node a few years ago for me was out of the question, working in offices full time it was not realistic of me to be able to guarantee a quick response to any potential issues or downtime. Moving to 100% remote working in the last year with COVID has completely changed that situation. I now have hours of additional free time every day and my working hours are whatever I like.

### My interest in notary nodes
The main reason for wanting to run a notary node for me is time and investment, and I don’t mean in the monetary sense. I’m old enough to remember the days when the internet was mostly aliased, private, and quite heavily decentralised. Where games had master servers, chat protocols were open and not everything was trying to track you or mine your data. I want to provide code bounties to get the community building higher quality tools. Or incentivise influencers on standard platforms to use/test out decentralised alternatives. I want the world to be interested not just in Komodo, but in crypto and privacy as a whole, because if the average person wants to use our platforms, we all benefit.



## Why vote majora31?
- Wealth of DevOps and Development experience.
- Fast, secure and up to date servers, with a fast response time should any issues arise.
- A passion to combat the public image problem that privacy and decentralised problems now face.
- I am currently investigating launching a branded DEX to a third party community. I've seen ptyx sucessfully do so with Dodgecoin, and I'd like to scope out and contribute to building one myself.
- Code bounties to improve the quality of the tooling to make it more accessible.


## Why not vote majora31?
I'm new here, and I acknowledge my shortcomings. I'm going to list a few here.
- I don't have a history of being active in the community. I am however known to the team, and whilst I've not been active, I have been paying attention.
- I've not proven myself just yet. I know I've not ran nodes before, I know I've not shown this before.

I'm no fool, I know these are concerns for everyone reading this. So scroll down to the bottom and let's get in touch. Let's talk tech over a game of Among us!


## Server Specs
I'm new to this of course, my current server is actually a small ryzen with 64gb ram based in London, but I will be expanding hopefully after receiving your vote. The primary and secondary servers I will host will have a minimum of the following:

```
CPU: AMD Epyc 7351P
RAM: 128GB
STORAGE: 2x 1TB NVME
BANDWIDTH: 100Mbps guarenteed
```
These will be hosted on different providers for redundancy and decentralisation. My goal is to provide the best possible service, not necessarily just the cheapest minimum viable.


### Thank you very much for voting for me and trusting me with securing the Komodo Notary Node network.
