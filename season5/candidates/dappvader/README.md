## About me ##
- <b>Top 3</b> Notary Node operator in Southern Hemisphere region
- 5+ years of experience in server maintenance and operational support
- Blockchain enthusiast, made my very first Bitcoin on Radeon GPU within a couple of months after learning about the technology in late 2013
- Komodo platform admirer and supporter through transferring a portion of my rewards to the CHIPS fund
- Huge fan of Star Wars franchise

After joining the Notary Node network in Season 4 my interest in the community and blockchain technology has been rapidly growing. I definitely expanded my knowledge to become a reliable operator. My main goal is to efficiently maintain a node whilst keeping a high level of productivity and security. With a proven track record of successful node administration, I would be grateful for the opportunity to participate in the upcoming season.
