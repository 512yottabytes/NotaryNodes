# Kolo is back (as a Notary Node)

## Voting and node information

Region: **AR**  
Address: **RKCXF7EYaAJHmiyDKmubhQ88dYc7CbTZxx**  

Node will be deployed on a high end equipment based in AR region. Equipment is already in place and ready to serve.

My next season roadmap includes deploying a cloud-based Notary Node using anycast and multiple locations in AR and SH region. This requires current NN software to be wrapped in proper scripts and Dockerized.
