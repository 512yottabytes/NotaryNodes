## Resume
To keep it short, this is my first time participating in a NN election, I am currently running a testnode on the 2021 notary testnet and doing alright (you can find the daily result here https://dexstats.info/testnet.php). I am a geek who has experience in running & maintaining servers & a 3D printing hobbyist. I hope you will hope for me so that I would have a chance to become a NN operator for the first time, thank you in advance.
## Contributions
- I will promise to fulfill my duties as a NN operator, keeping my nodes highly available as much as possible.
- I will also donate 100 KMD each month to the TOKEL project .
