## About me 
Since I was young, I'am interested in Computer Science. Quickly, I had developed websites, managing database, developping tools in differents languages, deploying and monitoring infrastructures (Game and communication servers).
Eversince I graduated, I'm working as an IT Solution Engineer (on a daily basis). My everyday work consist in finding inovative IT solutions to multiple problems.
I'm also a crypto enthousiastic for a long time now, but became really active by the end of 2016 first as a single miner and further as a pool operator. I was working hard on deploying a high quality mining pool with phm87. 

## About Unimining (golden year)
In a few month, we deployed a pool holding about 60 assets and managing about 10.000 individual miners. 
To follow this fast increasing demand, we had to invest in multiple servers, reaching about 10 machines at our peak. 
I deployed the full infrastructure of Unimining focusing on high availability and scalability. This also required to implement a lot of automations and monitoring (hardware, security, software, coin daemon,...). 

Unfortunately, the bankrupcy of a big exchange led to lost  important fund, that forced us to reduce drastically this infrastructure and to keep it running in a minimal way.


## Why vote for me ?

I have became active to the community since opening of Testnet S5. Before I was a long time KMD holder.

### Few years Mining experiences, Altcoins and Pool Operator.  

I gained a great experience in working on and managing an important amount of coin daemons in a complexe infrastructure. 

### Testnet proven performance
I've started by setuping a NotaryNode in the TestNet to undestand the technology and try to play with all thoses codes and tools. At first, I had no ambition to become a candidate.
But after few weeks of testing and operating, I dealt with very interesting functionalities that I want to learn in more details and working with more actively. I am very interested in  contributing to this very interesting technology. 

## Contributions / Donations to projects / What to do with earnings. 

* Pay High quality server to host notarizations services. I'am ready to relocate server in another datecenter if performance are bad or to improve decentralisation (in the same zone of course). For now i'am working with a well known provider that provides hosting in Australia (Sydney).  
* Offers additionals servers to host more services that community requires (explorers, electrumx servers, alternative bootstraps).
* Work in a clear and transparent way with all operators. Provide configuration, code and automation (bash, python, scripting) with the community.
* Contribution of a minimum of 10% mounthly earning to active and promising project.
