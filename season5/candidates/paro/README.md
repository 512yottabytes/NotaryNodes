## Who am I?

-I have worked with Dimxy for more than a year as a test developer and assistant developer in the Marmara Credit Loops Project. Under the leadership of Jl777, we developed the project in MCL(Marmara Credit Loops) and enabled the MCL Project to start smoothly. Some time after the MCL Project was completed, I left the project team of my own accord. I participated in the 4th season of the Komodo Notary with the name of Marmarachain and I started my notary adventure here. I am still continuing my duty as Komodo Notary in season 4. At the same time I am doing my duty as Ambassador of Turkey Komodo. I continue to popularize and promote Komodo in Turkey. I participated in the workshops as an instructor at various universities in Turkey while working in the Project MCL. I gave trainings to explain and introduce parts of Komodo and Antara Framework. In the 5th season, I want to continue my job as an individual at Komodo Notary.
